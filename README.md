# JackInit

## About

I use Ubuntu Studio a fair bit, but one of the issues is that Pulse Audio and Jack can sometimes fight with eachother. I've worked out a way around this by creating a script that can be run when your desktop session starts to fire up Jack, and make it the default for Pulse Audio.

I also like to apply an EQ when I'm listening to music from Spotify etc, so I've created a Jack Rack definition with that EQ, and a script to wire it in.

I have aspirations to build a system which can save and restore complete Jack graphs, including starting up the applications with the necessary start parameters to get them back to where they were last.
